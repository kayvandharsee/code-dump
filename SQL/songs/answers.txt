1. I would say they have a groovy aura, as they have a relatively high danceability level,
combined with an above average valence which shows they are usually listening to more positive music. Their energy is slightly below average,
which makes me believe they are more of a slow dancer.

2. The flaws in this calculation would be the fact that tempo and key are not included, which can help signify how upbeat and the mood conveyed
by the instruments. I would include these in my calculation of aura.
