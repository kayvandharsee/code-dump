Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

Many of the teams with a high percentage of winning with low simulations had their percentage drop as the simulations increased. The most notable was Switzerland that had 30% with 10 simulations but only 10.4% with 1 million simulations.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

I think 1000 simulations would be good enough, as they produce a very similar output to the higher simulations, yet have a run time comparable to that of the lower simulations.
